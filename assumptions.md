# Assumptions

- Single elevator
- No capacity limits
- Move between floors in a single step (not continuous)

# Features Not Implemented

- **Restricting how many people/weight can be on the elevator at once**

  It is a bit difficult to keep track of the weight of the elevator since multiple people can get on and off at the same stop. It would be much easier in real world practice where you can just measure the weight and not really care how many people are getting on and off at a single stop.

- **Multiple elevators in the same building**

  Doesn't work with multiple elevators in the same building (not too hard to add however).

- **Visual representation**

  Visually show the elevator.
